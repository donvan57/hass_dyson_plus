"""Dyson device wrapper providing direct MQTT communication and control.

This module implements the core DysonDevice class that handles all communication
with Dyson devices using the paho-mqtt library. It provides a comprehensive API
for device connection management, state monitoring, environmental data collection,
and device control operations.

Key Features:
    - Direct MQTT communication with local and cloud connections
    - Real-time environmental data streaming (PM2.5, PM10, VOC, temperature, etc.)
    - Complete device control API (fan speed, oscillation, heating, etc.)
    - Automatic connection failover (local → cloud → reconnection)
    - Heartbeat monitoring and automatic reconnection
    - Filter life tracking and maintenance operations
    - Advanced oscillation with custom angle control
    - Sleep timer and scheduling functionality

Connection Types:
    - local_only: Direct local network connection only
    - cloud_only: Dyson cloud service connection only
    - local_cloud_fallback: Local preferred with cloud fallback (default)

Supported Device Categories:
    - Pure series (air purifiers): PM monitoring, filter management
    - Hot+Cool series (heater/fan): Temperature control, heating modes
    - Humidify series: Humidity control and water tank monitoring
    - Lightcycle series: Lighting control and circadian rhythm

    """Primary interface for Dyson device communication and control.

    This class provides comprehensive access to Dyson device functionality through
    direct MQTT communication. It handles connection management, real-time data
    streaming, device control, and environmental monitoring.

    The device wrapper automatically manages:
    - MQTT connection establishment and maintenance
    - Heartbeat monitoring for connection health
    - Environmental data collection and caching
    - Command execution with proper formatting
    - Connection failover between local and cloud endpoints
    - Filter life tracking and maintenance scheduling

    Attributes:
        serial_number: Unique device identifier
        host: Local network address for direct connection
        credential: Authentication credential for MQTT
        capabilities: List of device capability strings
        connection_type: Connection strategy (local_only, cloud_only, local_cloud_fallback)
        is_connected: Current connection status
        connection_status: Detailed connection state (LOCAL/CLOUD/DISCONNECTED)

    Environmental Properties:
        pm25: PM2.5 particulate matter (μg/m³)
        pm10: PM10 particulate matter (μg/m³)
        voc: Volatile organic compounds index
        nox: Nitrogen dioxide index
        temperature: Current temperature (°C)
        humidity: Relative humidity (%)

    Device State Properties:
        fan_power: Fan power state (on/off)
        fan_speed: Current fan speed (1-10)
        night_mode: Night mode status
        auto_mode: Automatic speed adjustment status
        oscillation_enabled: Oscillation state
        heating_mode: Heating mode (OFF/HEAT/AUTO)
        target_temperature: Target temperature for heating

    Filter Properties:
        hepa_filter_life: HEPA filter remaining life (0-100%)
        carbon_filter_life: Carbon filter remaining life (0-100%)

    Example:
        Basic device setup and control:

        >>> device = DysonDevice(
        >>>     hass=hass,
        >>>     serial_number="VS6-EU-HJA1234A",
        >>>     host="192.168.1.100",
        >>>     credential="device_credential",
        >>>     capabilities=["WiFi", "ExtendedAQ", "Heat"]
        >>> )
        >>>
        >>> # Connect and get initial state
        >>> await device.connect()
        >>> state = await device.get_state()
        >>>
        >>> # Control fan speed and oscillation
        >>> await device.set_fan_speed(7)
        >>> await device.set_oscillation(True)
        >>>
        >>> # Monitor environmental data
        >>> pm25_level = device.pm25
        >>> temperature = device.temperature
        >>>
        >>> # Set up heating (if supported)
        >>> if "Heat" in device.capabilities:
        >>>     await device.set_target_temperature(22.0)
        >>>     await device.set_heating_mode("HEAT")

    Note:
        The device automatically handles connection management including
        heartbeat monitoring, reconnection attempts, and failover between
        local and cloud connections based on the configured connection_type.

        Environmental data is streamed in real-time via MQTT callbacks,
        providing immediate updates when air quality changes.

        All control methods are asynchronous and may raise RuntimeError
        if the device is not connected when commands are sent.

                - "REQUEST-CURRENT-FAULTS": Request device fault status

                - "hmax": Target temperature ("2731" + temp in Kelvin)

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: If device is not connected or MQTT client unavailable
            Exception: If command publishing fails or data formatting invalid

        Example:

            >>> await device.send_command("STATE-SET", {
            >>>     "nmod": "ON",
            >>>     "auto": "ON"
            >>> })
            >>>

            >>>     "hmax": "2953"  # 22°C = 295.15K = 2951.5 ≈ 2953
            >>> })
            >>>
            >>> # Request current state
            >>> await device.send_command("REQUEST-CURRENT-STATE")

        Note:
            Commands are executed asynchronously and may take 1-3 seconds
            for the device to process and reflect in state updates.

            Temperature values are sent in Kelvin * 10 format. For example,
            22°C = 295.15K = 2951.5 ≈ 2953.

            The device will respond with updated state via MQTT callbacks,
            triggering coordinator updates in Home Assistant.
